Add new dependencies using **Bower** and then run the **Grunt** task to load them:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ bower install --save jquery\r\n$ grunt wiredep\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works if the package author has followed the [Bower spec](https://github.com/bower/bower.json-spec). If the files are not automatically added to your source code, check with the package's repo for support and/or file an issue with them to have it updated.\r\n\r\nTo manually add dependencies, `bower install --save depName` to get the files, then add a `script` or `style` tag to your `index.html` or another appropriate place.\r\n\r\nThe components are installed in the root of the project at `/bower_components`. To reference them from index.html, use `src=\"bower_components\"` or `src=\"/bower_components\"`. Treat the `bower_components` directory as if it was a sibling to `index.html`.\r\n\r\n*Testing Note*: a project checked into source control and later checked out needs to have `bower install` run from the `test` folder as well as from the project root.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Grunt Serve Note\r\n\r\nNote: `grunt server` was used for previewing in earlier versions of the project, and has since been deprecated in favor of `grunt serve`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Docs\r\n\r\nWe have [recipes](docs/recipes) for integrating other popular technologies like Compass.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\n* `--skip-install`\r\n\r\n  Skips the automatic execution of `bower` and `npm` after scaffolding has finished.\r\n\r\n* `--test-framework=<framework>`\r\n\r\n  Defaults to `mocha`. Can be switched for another supported testing framework like `jasmine`.\r\n\r\n* `--coffee`\r\n\r\n  Add support for [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nSee the [contributing docs](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/blob/master/contributing.md).\r\n\r\nNote: We are regularly asked whether we can add or take away features. If a change is good enough to have a positive impact on all users, we are happy to consider it.\r\n\r\nIf not, `generator-webapp` is fork-friendly and you can always maintain a custom version which you `npm install && npm link` to continue using via `yo webapp` or a name of your choosing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
